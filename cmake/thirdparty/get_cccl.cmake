# NVIDIA/cccl provides CCCL (which includes cudax). This project currently needs
# unreleased cudax HyperLogLog APIs. Pin a known-good CCCL main commit and assign
# it a synthetic version newer than the latest real CCCL release, so
# CPMFindPackage will not silently accept an older CCCL install from disk.
#
# TODO(find_package): once NVIDIA/cccl ships a tagged release containing the
# required cudax HyperLogLog policy and explicit stream / memory-resource APIs,
# replace the synthetic version and commit pin with that release version, e.g.:
#
#   find_package(CCCL X.Y.Z CONFIG QUIET COMPONENTS cudax)
#   if(CCCL_FOUND)
#     message(STATUS "datasketches_cuda: using installed CCCL ${CCCL_VERSION}")
#     return()
#   endif()
#   message(STATUS "datasketches_cuda: CCCL >= X.Y.Z not found -- fetching via CPM")
#
# CCCL_ENABLE_UNSTABLE must stay ON: cccl/CMakeLists.txt gates CCCL_ENABLE_CUDAX
# behind it, and hll/include/hll_sketch.hpp uses cuda::experimental::cuco::hyperloglog.
#
# Developer override: -DCPM_CCCL_SOURCE=/path/to/local/cccl (CPM-native).
