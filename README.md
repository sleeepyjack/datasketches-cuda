# Apache® DataSketches™ Core CUDA Library Component

> **Note:** This project is experimental and under active development. APIs and
> behavior may change without notice.

This is the core CUDA component of the DataSketches library.  It contains sketching algorithms that can be accessed directly from user applications.

Note that we have parallel core library components for Java, C++, Python, GO, and Rush implementations of many of the same sketch algorithms:

- [datasketches-java](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-java)
- [datasketches-cpp](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-cpp)
- [datasketches-python](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-python)
- [datasketches-go](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-go)
- [datasketches-rust](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-rust)

Please visit the main [DataSketches website](https://datasketches.apache.org) for more information.

## Scope

This is a header-only INTERFACE library. It implements HyperLogLog with the
`HLL_8` target type and an initial GPU Theta sketch with union, intersection,
and A-not-B. HLL images and ordered, uncompressed compact Theta v3 images are
compatible with `datasketches-cpp`. Other sketch families and variants remain
on the roadmap (see [Known Issues](#known-issues)).

HLL example:

```cpp
#include <cuda/devices>
#include <cuda/memory_pool>
#include <cuda/stream>
#include <datasketches/cuda/hll.hpp>

cuda::stream stream{cuda::devices[0]};
auto mr = cuda::device_default_memory_pool(cuda::devices[0]);

datasketches::cuda::hll_sketch<std::uint64_t> sketch(stream, mr, /*lgK=*/12);
sketch.update(stream, dev_keys.begin(), dev_keys.end());
double estimate = sketch.get_estimate(stream);

auto bytes = sketch.serialize_compact(stream);    // GPU -> CPU wire format
auto cpu   = datasketches::hll_sketch::deserialize(bytes.data(), bytes.size());
```

`hll_sketch` is a thin handle around `detail::hll::sketch_impl`, which in turn
owns a `cuda::experimental::cuco::hyperloglog` parameterized by a
`detail::hll::policy` (matching hash, bit-slicing, and seed). Construction and
CUDA-touching member functions take an explicit `cuda::stream_ref` as the first
argument; construction and deserialization also require an explicit device
memory resource. Streams used with `update_async` or `merge_async` must be
synchronized or otherwise ordered before the sketch is destroyed.

Theta example:

```cpp
#include <datasketches/cuda/theta.hpp>

datasketches::cuda::theta_sketch<std::uint64_t> a(stream, mr, /*lg_k=*/12);
datasketches::cuda::theta_sketch<std::uint64_t> b(stream, mr, /*lg_k=*/12);
a.update(stream, dev_a.begin(), dev_a.end());
b.update(stream, dev_b.begin(), dev_b.end());

a.intersect(stream, b);
double estimate = a.get_estimate(stream);

auto bytes = a.serialize_compact(stream);
auto cpu = datasketches::compact_theta_sketch::deserialize(
  bytes.data(), bytes.size());
```

The current Theta prototype supports only `lg_k=12`. A batch update uses an
occupancy-sized persistent grid and derives its shared-memory set capacity from
the active device's opt-in shared-memory limit. Each block retains its
partition's smallest hashes, then a single device-wide sort and unique step
produces the ordered sketch. `update_async` enqueues the pipeline without
synchronizing; state-reading methods take a stream and synchronize before
returning. Set operations remain synchronous.

## Build & Runtime Dependencies

Required:

- CMake >= 3.30
- A C++17-capable host compiler (GCC 13.2+ verified; older GCC may work if it accepts C++17 and is supported by the CUDA toolkit)
- CUDA Toolkit >= 12.0 (12.4 verified)
- An NVIDIA GPU with compute capability supported by the active CUDA Toolkit (configured via `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES`; defaults to `native`)

Fetched automatically via CPM at configure time (no manual install required):

- [NVIDIA/cccl](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl) — pinned to commit `cba1df5786a2ffabc85887a9bfb1b7febee6232d` as synthetic version `3.5.2` while this library develops against unreleased cudax HLL APIs. This should move to a real CCCL release once the required APIs are tagged.
- [apache/datasketches-cpp](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-cpp) `5.2.0` (fall-back if `find_package(DataSketches 5.0.0 CONFIG)` does not locate a system install)
- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) `3.5.3` (test-only)
- [NVIDIA/nvbench](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvbench) (benchmark-only, fetched when `BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON`)

## Compilation and Test

Standard CMake workflow:

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Common options:

- `-DBUILD_TESTS=OFF` to skip building tests (defaults to `ON` at top level, `OFF` when consumed via `add_subdirectory`/CPM)
- `-DBUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON` to build the nvbench benchmarks (defaults to `OFF`; binaries land in `build/benchmarks`)
- `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=<arch>` to target a specific GPU (e.g. `80` for A100; defaults to `native`)
- `-DCPM_CCCL_SOURCE=/path/to/local/cccl` to point CPM at a local CCCL checkout instead of fetching

Optional developer targets (added at top-level configure when `clang-format` is on `PATH`):

```bash
cmake --build build --target format        # format the tree in place
cmake --build build --target format-check  # dry-run, non-zero on diff
```

A `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is also provided for automatic formatting of
staged files on `git commit`. Install once with `pre-commit install`.

## Consuming the library

Either `add_subdirectory` / CPM:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(path/to/datasketches-cuda)
target_link_libraries(my_target PRIVATE datasketches::cuda)
```

Or `find_package` after installing:

```cmake
find_package(datasketches_cuda CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_target PRIVATE datasketches::cuda)
```

The installed package config propagates CUDAToolkit, CCCL, and
datasketches-cpp through `find_dependency`. These dependencies are not bundled
or installed by `datasketches_cuda`, so downstream `find_package` consumers
must make them discoverable through `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` or the normal CMake
package search paths. Consumption via `add_subdirectory` or CPM works without
additional dependency setup.

## Known Issues

- **HLL_8 only.** `HLL_4` and `HLL_6` packing are not yet implemented; constructing with those throws `std::invalid_argument`. `AuxHashMap` (the HLL_4 exception table) is also pending.
- **Initial Theta surface.** Theta currently accepts primitive numeric keys and
  ordered, uncompressed compact-v3 images. Strings and byte spans, unordered or
  update-sketch images, compressed v4, and legacy wire versions are pending.
- **No LIST / SET deserialization.** The wire format's small-cardinality modes are rejected at parse. Sketches must already be in HLL mode.
- **Round-trip diverges on `FLAGS` (oooFlag) and `hipAccum`.** GPU output always sets `oooFlag=1` (pins CPU side to the Composite estimator) and `hipAccum=0` (no HIP tracking on parallel atomic update). All other bytes round-trip exactly.
- **CCCL uses a synthetic development version.** Until upstream tags a CCCL release containing the required cudax HLL policy and explicit stream / memory-resource APIs, `cmake/thirdparty/get_cccl.cmake` uses `CPMFindPackage` with synthetic version `3.5.2` and a pinned CCCL main commit. This prevents automatically accepting older CCCL installs from disk while keeping an explicit `CPM_CCCL_SOURCE` override available for development.
- **No driver on some dev hosts.** CI gates the runtime parity test (`parity_test.cu`); host-only tests (preamble, reduction state, normalizing hasher, composite finalizer, policy compile) pass without a GPU.
